- find out why when moving a double obelisk onto a single obelisk, the game saves twice
	making the second save (the one we see) error out
	- the issue is due to the script adding the "set_square" click handler on the div as
		a piece, and then again as a highlighted move option
		this also causes issues when the highlight is removed, so is the click handler
		for the piece, which makes the piece not clickable anymore
		- I should probably check and make sure the user wants to move onto that piece as
			well, and not just assume that they don't want to move the second piece clicked instead

- when game is first loaded, load previous board, wait 1 second, blink the piece moved,
	refresh board with current board (do the move), wait 1 second, and then fire laser as normal

- get replay buttons working

- don't show success messages if email is not sent

- if same board configuration is seen in a game for the third time, the next player can declare a draw

setup only needs to hold silver piece placements
as red is reflected through the origin.
(if red pieces are given, don't dissallow, some setups
may not need be reflected)


board layout (silver, red is lowercase)
P - pharaoh (target)
A - pyramid (1-sided mirror, NE .\ ) - needs 4 characters to show orientation
	B - SE `/
	C - SW \`
	D - NW /.
X - djed (2-sided mirror, NE-SW \ ) - needs 2 characters to show orientation
	Y - NW-SE /
V - Obelisk (defense block) - needs 2 characters to show stacking
	W - double stacked obelisks
H - eye of horus (splitter, NE-SW \ ) - needs 2 characters to show orientation
	I - NW-SE /
T - Tower of Kadesh base ( x4 )


R - red (player color)

red laser comes down from above A8
silver laser comes up from below J1

A1 = 70 -> A8 = 00
B1 = 71 -> B8 = 01
...
J1 = 79 -> J8 = 09

origin reflect function:

reflect = 79 - origin
