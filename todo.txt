- make hover tooltips better

- add ability to hit own laser from side as option

- for revisions for setups, allow the same name for the setup and when
	a user creates a revision or edits their setup, it creates a new setup
	and inactivates the previous setup, and then either sort by create
	date, or add a field in the table called revision and increment that
	and when we pull the setup, order by created or revision number, and
	use the most recent.

- add more stats:
	player's most played setup
	player's favorite setup
	player's worst setup
	player's favorite opponent
		win-loss per opponent
	etc...

- build game reader for saved games

- don't refresh page if an email success message is sent for things
	like resend invites, nudges, etc.  just make changes to html if needed

- add a different method for removing the click on the piece, because
	clicking the piece again doesn't work for rotatable pieces

- don't show success messages if email is not sent for things like
	nudge, that are only emails possibly for other things like invite,
	etc. that are largely email dependent
	- make accept invite and withdraw invite pages ajax powered and
		just remove the item from the table (and other places as well)

- fully convert times to UTC in MySQL and back to user's timezone everywhere
	dates are output

- add showdown to messages (JS port of Markdown, in zz_scripts_js)
