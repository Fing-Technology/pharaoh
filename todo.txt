- separate out the setups page and the stats page, have game/setup
	stats on stats page and a list of setups with modals on setups page,
	and have a link to create new setup as well as the action links for
	the setups

- for revisions for setups, allow the same name for the setup and when
	a user creates a revision or edits their setup, it creates a new setup
	and inactivates the previous setup, and then either sort by create
	date, or add a field in the table called revision and increment that
	and when we pull the setup, order by created or revision number, and
	use the most recent.

- add more stats:
	white wins per setup
	red wins per setup
	white wins per user
	red wins per user
	player's favorite setup
	player's worst setup
	etc...

- add game 2.0 rules, but make them inter-operable with current options
	things like:
	make laser type selectable
		if hitting front and/or side of laser counts as "hit" (if 2.0 style)
		is laser movable (if 2.0 style)
			is rotatable 360 (if movable)
	make obelisk type selectable
		if hitting front and/or sides and/or back count as "hit" (if 2.0 style)

- add options for selecting which pieces are swappable with which
	other pieces

- build game reader for saved games

- don't refresh page if an email success message is sent for things
	like resend invites, nudges, etc.  just make changes to html if needed

- add a different method for removing the click on the piece, because
	clicking the piece again doesn't work for rotatable pieces
	- maybe run check and if two clicks happen really fast together (<
		250ms) pop-up a dialogue box asking if they meant to do that

- don't show success messages if email is not sent for things like
	nudge, that are only emails possibly for other things like invite,
	etc. that are largely email dependent

- fully convert times to UTC in MySQL and back to user's timezone everywhere
	dates are output
