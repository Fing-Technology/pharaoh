- add fields in database for setups for number of silver wins,
	red wins, number of draws, longest game, shortest game, and
	deleted or active flag and use those for game stats

- for revisions for setups, allow the same name for the setup and
	when a user creates a revision or edits their setup, it creates a new setup
	and inactivates the previous setup, and then either sort by
	create date, or add a field in the table called revision and increment that
	and when we pull the setup, order by created or revision number, and use the most recent.

- don't refresh page if an email success message is sent
	for things like resend invites, nudges, etc.  just make changes to html if needed

- add options for selecting which pieces are swappable with which other pieces

- add a different method for removing the click on the piece, because clicking the piece again
	doesn't work for rotatable pieces

- don't show success messages if email is not sent
	for things like nudge, that are only emails
	possibly for other things like invite, etc.
	that are largely email dependent

- store finished games in text files and create a game reader/player
