- nudge is broken

- add the option for "Laser Battle", possibly make it have options for
	every hit equals broken, or immune for X turns after hit

- make sure the game is deleting finished games

- add a different method for removing the click on the piece, because clicking the piece again
	doesn't work for rotatable pieces

- if same board configuration is seen in a game for the third time, the next player can declare a draw

- don't show success messages if email is not sent
	for things like nudge, that are only emails
	possibly for other things like invite, etc.
	that are largely email dependent
