- update scripts
	- use yepnope and cdn

- there are errors when trying to re-send invites
	- make sure everything is working with the invites
		- i didn't find any errors  =(
		- it may be something to do with the resend button being shown
			before it should be, or that the resnd time checker is off
			somehow.  it's basically failing due to being too new

- make hover tooltips better

- add ability to hit own laser from side as option

- for revisions for setups, allow the same name for the setup and when
	a user creates a revision or edits their setup, it creates a new
	setup and inactivates the previous setup, and then either sort by
	create date, or add a field in the table called revision and
	increment that and when we pull the setup, order by created or
	revision number, and use the most recent.

- add more stats:
	player's most played setup
	player's favorite setup
	player's worst setup
	player's favorite opponent
		win-loss per opponent
	etc...

- build game reader for saved games

- don't show success messages if email is not sent for things like
	nudge, that are only email dependent

- fully convert times to UTC in MySQL and back to user's timezone
	everywhere dates are output

- add showdown to messages (JS port of Markdown, in zz_scripts_js)
