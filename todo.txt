- add the option for "Laser Battle", possibly make it have options for
	every hit equals broken, or immune for X turns after hit
	- also... maybe find a way to change from alive to dead during
		laser firing like the piece hits

- find a way to make the dead and immune values decrement after that players
	turn, instead of after opponents turn.  the only value that should
	change after opponents turn, is setting initial dead value for hits

- add fields in database for setups for number of silver wins,
	red wins, number of draws, longest game, shortest game, and
	deleted or active flag and use those for game stats

- for revisions for setups, allow the same name for the setup and
	when a user creates a revision or edits their setup, it creates a new setup
	and inactivates the previous setup, and then either sort by
	create date, or add a field in the table called revision and increment that
	and when we pull the setup, order by created or revision number, and use the most recent.

- when a user performs an action, don't take them from the page
	if they send an invite, or accept and invite, leave them
	on the invite page, same with messages and whatnot
	unless they are deleting a message, then go to next

- fill a board with eyes, and see how many the system can actually handle
	make sure to remove the inifinite loop protoection first though
	- it can handle a full board of eyes

- don't refresh page if an email success message is sent
	for things like resend invites, nudges, etc.  just make changes to html if needed

- make sure invites don't count toward "active" users and do so in other games as well

- add options for selecting which pieces are swappable with which other pieces

- add a different method for removing the click on the piece, because clicking the piece again
	doesn't work for rotatable pieces

- don't show success messages if email is not sent
	for things like nudge, that are only emails
	possibly for other things like invite, etc.
	that are largely email dependent

- store finished games in text files and create a game reader/player
