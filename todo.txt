- don't refresh page if an email success message is sent
	for things like resend invites, nudges, etc.  just make changes to html if needed

- make sure invites don't count toward "active" users and do so in other games as well

- add the option for "Laser Battle", possibly make it have options for
	every hit equals broken, or immune for X turns after hit

- add options for selecting which pieces are swappable with which other pieces

- make sure the game is deleting finished games

- add a different method for removing the click on the piece, because clicking the piece again
	doesn't work for rotatable pieces


- don't show success messages if email is not sent
	for things like nudge, that are only emails
	possibly for other things like invite, etc.
	that are largely email dependent
