CURRENTLY WORKING ON:
------------------------------------------------

	making the Khet 2.0 stuff work...

	done:
		laser works as expected in pharaoh class
		setup creator has new pieces and all works
		game mechanics work for both anubises and sphynxes
		laser cannot point directly into wall

		setup table has new fields

		invite page has options

		invites are processed properly
		setup code is stored in invite

	need:
		add ability to hit self from side...  if requested (some of it is kinda built)

		other invite options ???

_______________________________________________________________________________

- make hover tooltips better

- for revisions for setups, allow the same name for the setup and when
	a user creates a revision or edits their setup, it creates a new setup
	and inactivates the previous setup, and then either sort by create
	date, or add a field in the table called revision and increment that
	and when we pull the setup, order by created or revision number, and
	use the most recent.

- add more stats:
	player's favorite setup
	player's worst setup
	player's favorite opponent
		win-loss per opponent
	etc...

- build game reader for saved games

- don't refresh page if an email success message is sent for things
	like resend invites, nudges, etc.  just make changes to html if needed

- add a different method for removing the click on the piece, because
	clicking the piece again doesn't work for rotatable pieces

- don't show success messages if email is not sent for things like
	nudge, that are only emails possibly for other things like invite,
	etc. that are largely email dependent

- fully convert times to UTC in MySQL and back to user's timezone everywhere
	dates are output

- add showdown to messages (JS port of Markdown, in zz_scripts_js)
