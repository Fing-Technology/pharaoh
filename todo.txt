- add ability to request undo

- revert back to ajaxing the form to prevent double posting, and page refresh after moving issues

- separate out the setups page and the stats page, have game/setup stats on stats page
	and a list of setups with modals on setups page, and have a link to create new setup
	as well as the action links for the setups

- for revisions for setups, allow the same name for the setup and
	when a user creates a revision or edits their setup, it creates a new setup
	and inactivates the previous setup, and then either sort by
	create date, or add a field in the table called revision and increment that
	and when we pull the setup, order by created or revision number, and use the most recent.

- don't refresh page if an email success message is sent
	for things like resend invites, nudges, etc.  just make changes to html if needed

- add options for selecting which pieces are swappable with which other pieces

- add a different method for removing the click on the piece, because clicking the piece again
	doesn't work for rotatable pieces
	- maybe run check and if two clicks happen really fast together (< 250ms) pop-up
		a dialogue box asking if they meant to do that

- don't show success messages if email is not sent
	for things like nudge, that are only emails
	possibly for other things like invite, etc.
	that are largely email dependent

- store finished games in text files and create a game reader/player
