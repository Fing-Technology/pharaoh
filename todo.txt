- when a user performs an action, don't take them from the page
	if they send an invite, or accept and invite, leave them
	on the invite page, same with messages and whatnot
	unless they are deleting a message, then go to next

- fill a board with eyes, and see how many the system can actually handle
	make sure to remove the inifinite loop protoection first though

- don't refresh page if an email success message is sent
	for things like resend invites, nudges, etc.  just make changes to html if needed

- make sure invites don't count toward "active" users and do so in other games as well

- add the option for "Laser Battle", possibly make it have options for
	every hit equals broken, or immune for X turns after hit

- add options for selecting which pieces are swappable with which other pieces

- make sure the game is deleting finished games... and draw games

- add a different method for removing the click on the piece, because clicking the piece again
	doesn't work for rotatable pieces

- don't show success messages if email is not sent
	for things like nudge, that are only emails
	possibly for other things like invite, etc.
	that are largely email dependent

- store finished games in text files and create a game reader/player
